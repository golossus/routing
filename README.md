[Golossus][1] is a set of reusable **Go modules** to facilitate the creation of 
web applications leveraging Go's standard packages, mainly **net/http**.

The routing module exposes a **Router** or commonly known as **Mux** to map urls to
specific handlers. It provides an enhanced set of features to improve default mux
capabilities:

* Binary tree search for static routes.
* Allows dynamic routes with parameters.
* Parameter constraints matching.
* Http verbs matching.
* Semantic interface.
* More to come...

Installation
------------

The routing package is just a common Go module. You can install it as any other Go module. 
To get more information just review the official [Go blog][2] regarding this topic.

Usage
-----

This is just a quick introduction, view the [GoDoc][3] for details.

Basic usage example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "log"

    "github.com/golossus/routing"
)

func Index(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprint(w, "Welcome!\n")
}

func Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ps := routing.GetURLParameters(r)
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "hello, %s!\n", ps.GetByName("name"))
}

func main() {
    router := routing.NewRouter()
    router.Get("/", Index)
    router.Get("/hello/{name}", Hello)

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```
